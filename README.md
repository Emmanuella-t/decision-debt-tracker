\# Decision Debt Tracker (ddt)



Decision Debt Tracker is a lightweight Python CLI tool that helps you track decisions you are delaying and calculates a “decision debt” score that grows over time. It also produces a weekly decision health score so you can measure how much unresolved decision pressure you’re carrying.



\## Why it matters
